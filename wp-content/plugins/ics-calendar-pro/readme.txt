== Changelog ==

= 1.2.1 - 2020.08.21 =

* Fixed search filter on month-with-sidebar view so the grid shows all matching events when filtering, not just the first three per day.
* Configured month-with-sidebar CSS to *only* show event end times in the sidebar, not the main grid, to avoid a frequent issue of the space allocated for the end time causing a blank line on most events, depending on the window width.

= 0.3.0 - 2019.12.30 =

* Bumped WordPress requirement to 5.3 and PHP requirement to 7.0.0. WordPress requirement is due to the use of the new `wp\_date()` function to replace `date\_i18n()`.
* Replaced all uses of `date\_i18n()` with `wp\_date()` (if translations are needed for display) or PHP `date()` function (if dates are being formatted for processing only). Currently also using `date()` to format time-only display, due to issues on certain servers with redundant timezone offset adjustments when using `wp_date()`.

* Fixed some CSS issues with Twenty Twenty theme.
* Refactored r34icspro\_get\_timezone() function.

* Completed month step navigation functionality for widget view introduced in version 0.2.8.

* Began development on "month with sidebar" view.

= 0.2.5 - 2019.10.02 =

* On grid view, made entire date header clickable to expand/collapse rather than just the toggle icon; hid toggle icon on closed state on phone breakpoint because it often overlaps date text.
* Renamed "Shortcode Builder" to "Calendar Builder". (Functionality still not yet implemented.)
* Updated panels in admin screen sidebar.
* Set bare minimum height for event blocks, to prevent first line of text being cut off vertically on very short events (less than 15 minutes).
* Minor CSS visual updates.

= 0.2.4.1 - 2019.09.30 =

* Updated to use new functions added to ICS Calendar. (This version requires ICS Calendar 4.3.1.)
* Fixed issue with event descriptions displaying at all times. (Should only display on hover/tap.)

= 0.2.4 - 2019.09.30 =

* Added time range handling to grid view. (Also increased spacing at top of time grid to account for extension of events that begin before displayed time range.)
* Changed minimum width of event hover state on grid view from 120 pixels to 180 pixels.

= 0.2.3 - 2019.09.27 =

* Updated grid template to use new R34ICS::event\_description\_html() method. (Requires ICS Calendar 4.3.0 or later.)
* Added missing color key below calendar.
* CSS and layout enhancements.

= 0.2.2 - 2019.09.23 =

* Changed handling of event background color to prevent illegible overlapping text on events that start at slightly different times. (Display still does not handle events that start at *very* close times, e.g. less than 15 minutes. For now users are encouraged to increase the `zoom` value if close staggered starts are needed.) **This change requires ICS Calendar v. 4.1.4.**
* Added toggle feature to grid view to focus on a single day.
* Reversed order of description and location in detail view.
* Added stub code for more advanced display of overlapping events. (Not yet implemented.)
* General layout improvements.
* Mobile optimizations.
* Minor refactoring.

= 0.2.1 - 2019.09.22 =

* Added default gray background colors for events in grid view if no custom colors are set.

= 0.2.0 - 2019.09.21 =

= 0.1.1 - 2019.09.12 =
